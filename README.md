Portfolio for myself

This website serves as a simple portfolio for myself. I work on it sporadically, so don't be surprised if the information is a little outdated.

I'm trying to update it more frequently, and will hopefully have it in a stable working state by the end of the summer, just for reference, I'm writing this on June 4th 2018.
